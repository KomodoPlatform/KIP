Our general open source software contribution <a href=https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>guidelines</a> apply whenever joining or opening improvement proposal discussions.
This repository aims to provide a structured and organized process for discussing and proposing Komodo-and AtomicDEX related improvements. All KIPs should be open to public discussion and revision before they can be reviewed & accepted. Therefor we ask you to check the roadmaps and issue tickets in the relevant repositories such as <a href=https://github.com/komodoplatform/komodo/issues>komodo core</a> and <a href=https://github.com/komodoplatform/AtomicDEX-API/issues>AtomicDEX</a> prior to opening the relevant discussion in the Komodo KIPs discord channel. Furthermore please open a issue ticket in this repository as you confirm your proposal is not redundant / a duplicate.

Please read and ensure you understood the <a href=https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md> Contributor Code of Conduct </a>. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
